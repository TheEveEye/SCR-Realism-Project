# SCR-Realism-Project

## THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED !!!
This project has been archived on the 24th of January due to lack of motivation towards the game Stepford County Railway and thus lack of motivation to work on the project as a whole. This means that the project is cancelled, and will not be worked on any further. The last stable release is difficult to use, due to lack of documentation that never really got worked on.

Our goal is to create a perfectly timed timetable for all stations and drivers in the Roblox Game "Stepford County Railway"
We achieve this, by manually recording timetables for all routes, and use those to create a more realistic shift experience.
